This is a template adapted from my own Masters thesis at McGill. I
spent a great deal of time while writing my thesis to get the
formatting done nicely. In the hopes of easing this process for other
graduate students I created this barebones template. I have tried to
comment throughout, describing both my formatting and the McGill
requirements as of August, 2018. The structure should be intuitive.
Images are stored in the img folder. Individual TeX sections are
stored in the tex folder. document.tex pulls the entire thesis
together. mystyle.sty contains all the packages and style
specifications. library.bib is a dummy biblatex file. As I explain in
title.tex, you have to acquire the McGill logo yourself as it is not
available to the public. The thesis is intended to be compiled with
XeLaTeX and the reference section is produced with Biber. If you are
experienced with LaTeX, it should be fairly easy to modify it to use
pdflatex and Bibtex (if you prefer them). Once my thesis has become
publicly available, I will include a link to it here so you can see
the template populated with figures, text and citations.
